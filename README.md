## About

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was the founder of the Maratha Empire in
western India. He is considered to be one of the greatest warriors of
his time and even today, stories of his exploits are narrated as a part
of the folklore. With his valor and great administrative skills, Shivaji
Maharaj carved out an enclave from the declining Adilshahi sultanate of
Bijapur. It eventually became the genesis of the Maratha Empire. After
establishing his rule, Shivaji Maharaj implemented a competent and
progressive administration with the help of a disciplined military and
well-established administrative set-up. Shivaji Maharaj is well-known
for his innovative military tactics that centered around
non-conventional methods leveraging strategic factors like geography,
speed, and surprise to defeat his more powerful enemies.
